# GAMsByHand
Builds some generalised additive model (GAM) and related (polynomial basis spline) architecture from scratch in Julia.

## Notes

This project largely aims to replicate in Julia the excellent work in [Generalised Additive Models](https://m-clark.github.io/generalized-additive-models/technical.html) by Michael Clark, which was originally written in R.
